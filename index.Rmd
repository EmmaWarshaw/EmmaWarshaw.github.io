### Welcome to my website!

This website has two pages: 

[About me](about.html)

[HW4: Interactive Dashboard](hw4_problem2.html)

For the dashboard, I used the [New York Restaurant inspection data](https://p8105.com/dataset_restaurant_inspections.html).  The first histogram is a plot of the total restaurants in each borough.  The box plot shows a distribution of rating scores in each borough.  The final histogram shows Thai restaurants marked as "critical" in Manhattan zip codes.  I really like Thai food and live in Manhattan.  Good to know which zip codes to avoid.   

## Fun Things...

We seem to be sharing pictures of pets in this class, so here's my entry.  

This is Giselle.  She's almost 14 years old but acts like a human toddler.  She enjoys barking at her food for no apparent reason and running errands in her stroller (she has two replaced knees and can't walk for long distances anymore).
